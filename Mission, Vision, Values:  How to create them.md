# Mission, Vision, Values:  How to create them (2 min)

Example:  [PUBLIC] Mochary Method - Vision 2031

## Mission

A mission should state the purpose of the company in one simple, short and memorable sentence. To do this, I like to answer the following question in as few words as possible:

Our purpose is to do what for whom?

## Vision

A vision is simply a prediction of what the company will look like far on the horizon once it has achieved massive success. This can take many forms. But I like to keep it as short as possible (so that it is memorable) while also reinforcing key components. To me, those components are: 

- Customer
- Problem
- Solution
- Moat

Therefore, to create the ten-year vision, I imagine it is ten years from now. We are the dominant company in the industry. I ask myself:

- What industry do we dominate?
- Who is our customer (this should be a real live human being, not a corporate entity)
- What pain do they have that we're solving for them?
- What is unique about our solution that causes the customer to choose us over the competition?
- What asset (human or physical) do we control that makes it difficult for any competitor to copy our solution? In other words, what is our moat?

## Values

There are many ways to create company values. Values should clearly define the behaviors that you want all team members to exhibit. Once created, you should hire for these behaviors and fire those unwilling to do these behaviors.

Here are two ways to determine what those behaviors are.

A simple one is to complete the following sentence: "The rest of you in the company can make all of the decisions from now on, as long as you â€¦." This is appropriate when the company is small, and values are entirely aspirational.

Another version is to acknowledge the culture that you already have. To do this, use a Brainstorming: written session to 

- Ask each Leadership Team member to write down several examples of a person in the company who is NOT on the Leadership Team and exhibits a behavior that they wish would be a universal behavior. Name the person and the behavior. 
- Of all the examples given, select 3-5.  
- These are now your values (with real examples!). 

This method is best used when the company already has a sizable team and existing culture.
